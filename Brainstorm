##Problem
1. Fill the event
2. Get the highest volume of donations
3. Increase awareness of women in tech
4. Data collection. Get the most signatures

##Data
- MTA turnstile data
- Income data
- Other tech events in the area (Meetup?)
- Weather

##Constraints
- Closed subways

##Questions
- Profile of likely donors (e.g. religious, poor, rich, female)?
- How long should an ideal interaction be?
- Dynamic placement? Have teams move between stations during the day as volume changes?
- Are there anomalies in the MTA data? E.g the Barclays Center may have massive traffic occasionally, but that can be hard to predict from the MTA schedule
