##Problem statement
- At which stations and at which times of day can we position workers to get the greatest number of signatures for people interested in attending a women-in-tech gala?

##Goals
- Get the most signatures from people we expect will be interested in tech. 
- Target people during the workday (going to work, at lunch, going home).
- Only target neighborhoods we know have a lot of tech companies.
- get top 50 stations
- from those 50, only pick the ones in tech-heavy neighborhoods

##Problem
1. Fill the event
2. Get the highest volume of donations
3. Increase awareness of women in tech
4. Data collection. Get the most signatures

##Data
- MTA turnstile data
- Income data
- Other tech events in the area (Meetup?)
- Weather

##Constraints
- Closed subways

##Questions
- Profile of likely donors (e.g. religious, poor, rich, female)?
- How long should an ideal interaction be?
- Dynamic placement? Have teams move between stations during the day as volume changes?
- Are there anomalies in the MTA data? E.g the Barclays Center may have massive traffic occasionally, but that can be hard to predict from the MTA schedule
